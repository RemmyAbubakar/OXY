              Innovation is not static; it has pace, inventiveness and
              flexibility. We know that we will not succeed unless we challenge
              ourselves to not stand still but to ask ourselves how things can
              be done differently. Perfecting our performance means we need to
              be adaptable and open to change even if it makes us uncomfortable.
